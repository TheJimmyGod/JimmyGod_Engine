### **Introduction**
**JimmyGod Engine** is the custom game engine in C++ language with Direct3D rendering. The name JimmyGod comes from my vision that it will be a high quality and popular game engine. The game engine was started in November 2019, and continues to be updated and improved. The game engine consists of various libraries:*Input, Math, Graphics, AI, Machine Learning, and Physics*. **The input library** has support for mouse and keyboard. **The graphics library** allows to easily use GPU shaders to render 3D models with support for dynamic lighting, shadows, post processing, and animation. **The math library** has support for 3D geometry and linear algebra components. Moving on, **the AI library** has pathfinding, steering, finite-state-machine for simulating autonomous agents. For **the machine learning library**, I implemented K-means, Genetic Algorithm, Neural network, and linear regression to solve various problems. For the physics part, it includes a Verlet particle system with constraints to model object dynamics.

### **Guide to use JimmyGod Engine**

##### **Requirement**
###### Visual studio 2019
###### Latest SDK version

##### **Steps**
##### 1. Firstly, you should check your SDK version and Visual Studio version.
##### 2. Secondly, you should link the main library for your project.
###### **Examples:**
```C++
#include <JimmyGodEngine/Inc/JimmyGodEngine.h>
```
##### 3. Optionally, you can add Imgui components in your class
```C++
#include <ImGui/Inc/imgui.h>
```
